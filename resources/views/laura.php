    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>I felt a funeral</b> (1862) <i>Emily Dickinson</i></p>

    <p>
    I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,<br>
    And Mourners to and fro<br>
    Kept treading - treading - till it seemed <br>
    That Sense was breaking through -<br>
    <br><br>
    And when they all were seated,<br>
    A Service, like a Drum -<br>
    Kept beating - beating - till I thought <br>
    My Mind was going numb -<br>
    <br><br>
    And then I heard them lift a Box<br>
    And creak across my Soul<br>
    With those same Boots of Lead, again, <br>
    Then Space - began to toll,<br>
    <br><br>
    As all the Heavens were a Bell,<br>
    And Being, but an Ear,<br>
    And I, and Silence, some strange Race <br>
    Wrecked, solitary, here -<br>
    <br><br>
    And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br>
    And I dropped down, and down - <br>
    And hit a World, at every plunge, A<br>
    nd Finished knowing - then -<br>
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>Strange Fruit</b> (1937) <i>Abel Meeropol</i></p>


    <p>
    Southern trees bear a strange fruit<br>
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root <br>
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze <br>
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees<br>
<br><br>
Pastoral scene of the gallant South<br>
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth <br>
Scent of magnolia, sweet and fresh<br>
Then the sudden smell of burning fesh<br>
<br><br>

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck<br>
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck <br>
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop <br>
Here is a strange and bitter crop<br>
<br><br>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>Small Tactics</b> (1971) <i>Margaret Atwood</i></p>

<p>
[...]
<br><br>
For stones, <br>
opening is not easy
<br><br>
Staying closed is <br>
less pain but
<br><br>
your anger fnally<br>
is more dangerous
<br><br>
To be picked up and thrown <br>
(you won’t stop) against
<br><br>
the ground, picked up<br>
and thrown again and again
<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>Still I Rise</b> (1978) <i>Maya Angelou</i></p>

<p>
You may write me down in history <br>
&emsp;With your bitter, twisted lies, <br>
&emsp;You may trod me in the very dirt <br>
&emsp;But still, like dust, I’ll rise.<br>
<br><br>

Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
&emsp;Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
&emsp;’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells<br>
&emsp;Pumping in my living room.<br>
&emsp;Just like moons and like suns,<br>
&emsp;With the certainty of tides,<br>
&emsp;Just like hopes springing high,<br>
&emsp;Still I’ll rise.<br>
<br><br>
Did you want to see me broken?<br>
&emsp;Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>
&emsp;Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br>
&emsp;Weakened by my soulful cries?<br>
<br><br>
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>
&emsp;Don’t you take it awful hard<br>
&emsp;’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines<br>
&emsp;Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br>
<br><br>
You may shoot me with your words,<br>
&emsp;You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
&emsp;You may kill me with your hatefulness, <br>
&emsp;But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br>
<br><br>
Does my sexiness upset you?<br>
&emsp;Does it come as a surprise<br>
&emsp;That I dance like I’ve got diamonds <br>
&emsp;At the meeting of my thighs?<br>
<br><br>
Out of the huts of history’s shame <br>
&emsp;I rise<br>
&emsp;Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br>
&emsp;I rise<br>
&emsp;I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide, <br>
&emsp;Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
<br><br>

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear <br>
&emsp;I rise<br>
&emsp;Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br>
&emsp;I rise<br>
&emsp;Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, <br>
&emsp;I am the dream and the hope of the slave. <br>
&emsp;I rise<br>
&emsp;I rise <br>
&emsp;I rise.
